First FPS – Unreal Engine 5
This is a simple first-person target practice prototype. The player must shoot a required number of targets within a set time limit. I created this project to practice gameplay scripting, blueprint logic, timers, collision, and basic UX feedback.

Key Features:
	Timed objective: shoot X targets within Y seconds.
	Targets with hit detection and respawn logic.
	Blueprint logic for scoring, timer UI, and win/loss states.
	Simple level layout focused on clarity and flow.
	Basic sound and screen feedback.
	
This project strengthened my understanding of:
	Designing a clear objective.
	Balancing timing, difficulty, and pacing.
	Using blueprint logic for gameplay systems.
	Iterating quickly using UE5 tools.
	Testing and adjusting player experience through tuning.

To view the project:
